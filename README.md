# File tree :open_file_folder::unlock::paperclip:

Here my task was to follow the following requirements to create a program that would create a subfolder and file tree, 
depending on the data in structure variable.

## Requirements:
-	By default all folders are closed
-	When you click on a closed folder, folder opens. Otherwise close
-	When you click on file - nothing happen
- When you click on empty folder - nothing happen
-	If the top-level folder closes when the subfolder is open, then after reopening the top-level folder, the subfolder remains 
in the same state.
-	Use the appropriate icon if the folder is open or closed
-	Folder/File may be clickable out of name
-	The folder / file is clickable outside the title. (It means you can open folder by clicking on row instead title directly)

## Demonstration
